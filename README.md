DiceRoller3D is a SwiftUI app that features a 3D scene embedded within a View, where you'll find two 3D dice. By pressing a button, users can roll the dice using the physics engine of Xcode to create a realistic dice-rolling experience.

## Features

- SwiftUI integration with 3D SceneKit views
- 3D dice models made in blender

## Future Improvements

- Add a more realistic sound for dice bounds
- Support for various dice types and combinations
